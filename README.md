Text Summarization of Fine Food Reviews using Stacked LSTM with Attention Mechanism

Dataset available at: https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews

Generating summaries for Amazon Fine Food reviews by implementing the abstractive summarization using a stacked LSTM with 3 LSTM layers stacked on top of each other. In addition, used the Attention mechanism to further tackle weaknesses of the traditional LSTM model and allow it to account for differences in the importance of the input words.
